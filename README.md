# netflix-home-page
A Netflix home page using HTML and CSS is a web application designed to mimic the user interface and functionality of the Netflix streaming platform. It typically includes features such as a homepage with user login and registration forms, and responsive design for different devices. HTML is used to structure the content, while CSS is employed for styling and layout, replicating the look and feel of Netflix. Note that creating a fully functional clone would also require JavaScript and potentially a back-end technology for user authentication and content management.
